# Implementation-of-ML-model-for-Image-Classification
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Key features include data preprocessing, augmentation, and normalization, along with model selection leveraging the MobileNetV2 pre-trained model. The front-end uses Streamlit for an interactive web interface, and the backend employs Keras and TensorFlow. The model is deployed on cloud services for accessibility and scalability.
