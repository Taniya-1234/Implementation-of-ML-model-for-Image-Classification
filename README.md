# Implementation-of-ML-model-for-image-classification
This repository showcases a Streamlit-based application that integrates MobileNetV2 and a custom CIFAR-10 model for efficient image classification. Users can upload images and obtain predictions along with confidence levels from either model. The app includes a user-friendly navigation bar, enabling seamless switching and delivering real-time results, making it ideal for educational and practical scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Support for Two Models:**:
  - **MobileNetV2 (ImageNet)**: Capable of recognizing 1,000 different categories from the ImageNet dataset, including objects, animals, and more.
  - **Custom CIFAR-10 Model**: Tailored for identifying images into ten distinct classes like airplanes, automobiles, and birds.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**:
  - **Sidebar Menu:**: Effortlessly toggle between the MobileNetV2 and CIFAR-10 models using a modern sidebar.
  - **Instant Predictions:**: Upload an image to get predictions and confidence scores instantly.
    
- **For Learning and Real-World Use:**:
  - Perfect for exploring deep learning models and understanding their results.
  - Suitable for real-world scenarios requiring image classification.
